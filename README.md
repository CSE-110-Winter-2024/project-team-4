### Velocity Calculations from Iteration 1 to Iteration 2 in MS2

We started Milestone 2 assuming a velocity of about 0.6. However, as we made progress through Iteration 1, we realized that we didn't have enough time to finish all of the tasks, notably the recurring tasks. We had to move a total of about 7 hours worth of tasks into the next iteration (Iteration 2). However, when planning out of iterations, we didn't fully load up Iteration 2 so we had a few hours remaining in Iteration 2. This would mean we would have to up our velocity in order to have enough time to finish everything we wanted to.

We worked on Iteration 2 for about 6 days and spent on average 2 hours a day. With 5 people actively working in our group (the sixth member was never present), we had a total of 5*2*6 = 60 hours to complete about 37+4 = 41 hours worth of tasks. We added the 4 hours on top because we expected that's how long it would take to make sure that our GitHub was fully up to date and to submit the project. 41/60 = 0.68 which was the new velocity we had to follow to reach our goals of finishing all the tasks we needed to finish. This also ties in with the guess we made of needing to work more efficiently to finish more work than we initially accounted for in the second iteration.

## Getting Started

 - [ ] Look around the project.
   - The `docs/` directory may be helpful, as Slack/Discord messages are easy to lose.
     - This is a good place to put finalized user stories, standards, guidelines, meeting notes, etc
       that you want to stick with the repository in perpetuity (e.g. after the semester ends) e.g.
       for portfolio purposes.
     - Google Docs is easier for collaboration, but eventually you might want to put the
       finalized versions here for reference. (This way you can also reference them in PRs!)
 - [ ] Modify the `.github/pull_request_template.md` to suit your needs.
   - You **do not** need to use the exact same template, but justify your changes when you 
     PR the updated template.
 - [ ] Replace this README with something appropriate.
   - **When you do, replace the title to replace X with your team number.**
